This is a simple and minimalistic template repository for starting new data science and machine learning projects in
Python.

I created this template to help me speed up the setup process for my projects.
And to have a consistent structure across all my personal and professional projects.
I'm sharing it here in the hope that others find it useful.
So, feel free to use it as a starting point for your projects.

## Notable Features

- A predefined file and folder layout that should be suitable for most data science workflows.
- Easy dependency and environment management with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
- Extra configuration files for various tasks like linting, formatting, and testing.
